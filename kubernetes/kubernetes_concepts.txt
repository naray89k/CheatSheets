What is Kubernetes?
--------------------
Kubernetes is an open-source platform used to automate deployment and to scale containers across clusters of hosts providing container-centric infrastructure.
It is a container orchestrator.
It can run a Linux container.
  Launches a container
  Maintains and monitors the container site
  Performs container-oriented networking

Key Concepts
------------
Now, letâ€™s discuss the key points of this architecture.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pod:                      Group of containers
Label:                    Used to identify pods
Kubelet:                  Container agents, responsible for maintaining the set of pods
Proxy:                    The load balancer for pods, helping in distributing tasks across them
Etcd:                     A metadata service
CAdvisor:                 Used for monitoring resource usage and performance
Replication controller:   Manages pod replication
Scheduler:                Used for pod scheduling in worker nodes
API server:               Kubernetes API server
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

etcd:
-----
It is a distributed reliable key-value store used by kubernetes to store all data used to manage the cluster

Scheduler:
----------
Scheduler is responsible for distributing work or containers across multiple nodes.

Container Runtime:
------------------
It is framework that is responsible for running application in containers like Docker


Replication Controller:

Replica Sets:

Deployment:

Service Types:
--------------
NodePort:
---------
  *.  A NodePort service is the most primitive way to get external traffic directly to your service.
  *.  NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port on all the Nodes (the VMs), and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service.
  *.  This service runs within Kubernetes Node.
  *.  Port Range: 30000-32767

ClusterIP:
----------
  *.  A ClusterIP service is the default Kubernetes service created, when type is not explicitly mentioned in service definition yaml file. 
  *.  It gives you a service inside your cluster that other apps inside your cluster can access. 
  *.  There is no external access.

LoadBalancer:
-------------
  *.  A LoadBalancer service is the standard way to expose a service to the internet.
  *.  On GKE, this will spin up a Network Load Balancer that will give you a single IP address that will forward all traffic to your service
